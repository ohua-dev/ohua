# Examples here always need a distinct `name` property. For the fragments as
# many languages as desired can be provided, but must be unique. The order of
# the fragments determines the order of the tabs.
# Currently supported languages (`type`) are `java` and `rust`, if you want to
# add more you have to extend the `case` block in `tabs.html` accordingly.
# The code can either be specified as a `file`, which will also create a link to
# the source file on github. Alternatively a literal string can be provided via `code`.
